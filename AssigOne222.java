//         
// set up the launch time
// iterating through each position (degree) of the missile from Launchtown to Doomsville 

// and for each position/degree repeat the following steps until a solution is found or it is 
// determined there are no solutions
// • calculating how the laser would need to move to get there
// • calculating how the missile would need to move to get there
// • determining how many seconds the movement of each item 
// would take and, if the laser can get there no later than the 
// missile
// o determine the (x,y) coordinate of impact and the time
// o create a firing solution of these values
// o display the time and firing solution (you can make use 
// of the defined DecimalFormat objects to format the 
// output of Time and FiringSolution objects)
// • otherwise 
// o moving the missile to the next location (degree)
